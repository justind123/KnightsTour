KnightsTour
===========

The [knight's tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) refers to
the problem of finding a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard in which 
the knight visits every square exactly once. 

This repository contains a Java program that finds all the possible knight's tours
from a single starting position that the user defines using standard chessboard
position notion (e.g. "e4"). The chessboard is 5x5, as anything larger than that will
take a considerable amount of time to compute because the program is using a brute force approach.
